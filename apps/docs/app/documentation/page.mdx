# Introduction

CubicsUI is a multi faceted system that lets you build and manage your own component library in any language of your choice. It is a powerful tool that lets you create, manage and publish your own component library.

It also comes with some simple components that can be used as building blocks for your own components. 



There are two different methods of accessing these components

1. Using the **CubicsUI CLI** (recommended)
2. Installing packages using a package manager like `npm`

## Benefits of using CLI

- **Easy to use**: [CubicsUI CLI](/documentation/cli) is a simple command line tool that lets you create components using a simple command `cui create <name>`.

- **CubicsUI Studio**: If you like GUIs instead, [CubicsUI CLI](/documentation/cli) also comes with a [Studio](/documentation/cli/studio) that lets you manage your components and configurations easily.

- **No Dependencies**: [CubicsUI CLI](/documentation/cli) will not install any dependencies in your project and will only add the components to your current working directory.

- **Automation**: You can write scripts to automate the process of creating components to initialise new projects.
