# Collections

## Introduction

A small introduction to collections in CubicsUI

## Collections in CubicsUI Studio

### Projects

Projects are the main collections in CubicsUI Studio. You can create multiple projects in CubicsUI Studio. Each project can have multiple components, and configurations.

### Components

Components are the building blocks of your component library. You can create multiple components in a project. Each component consists of component definitions, script and style definitions.

These components can then be created in your own project by using the `cui create` command.
  
```sh npm2yarn
npx cui create <name>
```

### Configurations

Configurations are the settings that you can apply to a project. You can create multiple configurations in a project.
